## A quick note:

* This timer is my first JavaScript project on GitHub and on the internet for that matter.  
* I've used basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript code and terminal interface to develop the game, keeping simplicity in mind.
* Your feedback would be highly appreciated! Feel free to get in touch using the contact details on my GitHub profile.
